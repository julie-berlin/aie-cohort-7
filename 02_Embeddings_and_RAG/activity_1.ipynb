      "Response: The 'Michael Eisner Memorial Weak Executive Problem' refers to the tendency of a CEO or startup founder to hire an executive who is weak in the function that corresponds to their own strengths. This often occurs when the CEO has difficulty letting go of the role or function that originally brought them into a position of leadership. The context highlights an example of this problem with former Disney CEO Michael Eisner, who had been a successful TV network executive but struggled when he hired a weak executive for ABC after acquiring it. Instead of successfully turning around the network, Eisner claimed that he would be able to do so if he had more time, which illustrates the issue of relying on subpar talent to maintain a sense of control or superiority within a specific operational domain.\n",
