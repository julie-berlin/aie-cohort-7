    "The process of embedding is typically very time consuming and expensive:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Send text to OpenAI API endpoint\n",
    "2. Wait for processing  \n",

    "This occurs *every single time* a document gets converted into a vector representation.\n",

    "**Our Caching Solution:**\n",
    "1. Check local cache for previously computed embeddings\n",
    "2. If found: Return cached vector (instant, free)\n",
    "3. If not found: Call OpenAI API, store result in cache\n",

    "##### ❓ Question #1: Production Caching Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "What are some limitations you can see with this caching approach? When is this most/least useful for production systems? \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider:\n",
    "- **Memory vs Disk caching trade-offs**\n",
    "- **Cache invalidation strategies** \n",
    "- **Concurrent access patterns**\n",
    "- **Cache size management**\n",
    "- **Cold start scenarios**\n",
    "\n",
    "> NOTE: There is no single correct answer here! Discuss the trade-offs with your group.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### ✅ Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "The caching approach works well for repeated access patterns but adds complexity that may not be justified for highly dynamic or unique workloads. I recently saw an article that discussed the concept of \"hot\" and \"cold\" RAG storage. Cache would serve the cold docs and vector store the frequently changing ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cache Invalidation Challenges\n",
    "  - No automatic detection when source documents change\n",
    "  - Stale embeddings can persist indefinitely without manual cache clearing\n",
    "  - Difficult to implement time-based expiration for embeddings (they don't naturally \"expire\")\n",
    "\n",
    "- Storage & Memory Trade-offs\n",
    "  - Memory caching: Fast but limited by RAM, lost on restart\n",
    "  - Disk caching: Persistent but slower I/O, requires serialization overhead\n",
    "  - Hybrid approaches: Complex to implement correctly with consistency guarantees\n",
    "\n",
    "- Concurrency Issues\n",
    "  - Race conditions when multiple processes cache the same embedding simultaneously\n",
    "  - Cache corruption risks without proper locking mechanisms\n",
    "  - Distributed systems need cache synchronization strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cache Management Complexity\n",
    "  - Unbounded growth can exhaust storage/memory\n",
    "  - LRU/LFU eviction policies may remove frequently-needed embeddings\n",
    "  - No built-in metrics for cache hit rates or optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "Most Useful Scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Development/testing: Repeated runs on same datasets\n",
    "- Batch processing: Large documents with overlapping content\n",
    "- Interactive applications: Users asking similar questions\n",
    "- RAG systems: Same documents queried multiple times\n",
    "\n",
    "Least Useful Scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "- High document churn: Frequently changing content makes cache ineffective\n",
    "- Unique queries: One-off questions with no repetition patterns\n",
    "- Real-time systems: Cache lookup overhead may exceed direct API calls\n",
    "- Cold start environments: Serverless functions where cache doesn't persist\n",
    "\n",
    "Production Recommendations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Implement cache versioning for invalidation strategies\n",
    "- Monitor cache hit rates to justify complexity\n",
    "- Use persistent storage (Redis/database) for production\n",
    "- Set reasonable TTL policies even for embeddings\n",

    "   - What caching strategies work best for each agent type?\n",
    "   - How would you implement rate limiting and circuit breakers?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Discuss these trade-offs with your group!\n",
    "\n",
    "##### ✅ Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **When would you choose each agent type?**\n",
    "   - Simple Agent advantages/disadvantages\n",
    "     - For simple and straightforward queries. \n",
    "     - Could provide answers that aren't complete or ideal.\n",
    "   - Helpfulness Agent advantages/disadvantages\n",
    "     - For more complex queries where multiple tool uses may be involved.\n",
    "     - It's slower in an unpredictable way because it could try to get a helpful answer up to 10 times. We can change this of course. \n",
    "     - No guarantee that the helpfulness agent will return a helpful answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Production Considerations:**\n",
    "   - How does the helpfulness check affect latency?\n",
    "     - It will always add at least a small bit of latency to every query.\n",
    "   - What are the cost implications of iterative refinement?\n",
    "     - Each loop costs time, API use charges and more data to store/analyze\n",
    "     - Investment in experimentation tools and taking the time to run and analyze experiments\n",
    "   - How would you monitor agent performance in production?\n",
    "     - Response quality metrics (RAGAS), Performance metrics (logs, LangSmith), behavioral metrics (usage patterns and abandonment rates)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Scalability Questions:**\n",
    "   - How would these agents perform under high concurrent load?\n",
    "     - Caching works well under load with proper distributed design and tiered storage\n",
    "     - Implement fallback behaviors and settings, simpler models, cached responses, etc.\n",
    "     - They should be able to be horizontally scaled if containerized\n",
    "     - Using async processing and event driven architecture will protect from direct calls\n",
    "     - Enable streaming to show partial responses\n",
    "     - Embeddings managed in separate queues\n",
    "   - What caching strategies work best for each agent type?\n",
    "     - The RAG cache strategy of write through is probably acceptable, write-behind could also work.\n",
    "     - The LLM cache could use LRU to prevent storing too much data that may not be accessed.\n",
    "     - Memory cache such as Redis best for LLM cache\n",
    "   - How would you implement rate limiting and circuit breakers?\n",
    "     - Rate limiting prevents system overload and ensures fair resource allocation. Create a singleton that controls number of tokens allocated for a time period per user and per agent. Can use a sliding window pattern.\n",
    "     - Circuit breakers provide resilience against cascading failures. Add circuit breaker to model provider, vector db, embedding provider."

    "## Task 4: Guardrails Integration for Production Safety\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we'll integrate **Guardrails AI** into our production system to ensure our agents operate safely and within acceptable boundaries. Guardrails provide essential safety layers for production LLM applications by validating inputs, outputs, and behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🛡️ What are Guardrails?\n",
    "\n",
    "Guardrails are specialized validation systems that help \"catch\" when LLM interactions go outside desired parameters. They operate both **pre-generation** (input validation) and **post-generation** (output validation) to ensure safe, compliant, and on-topic responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Categories:**\n",
    "- **Topic Restriction**: Ensure conversations stay on-topic\n",
    "- **PII Protection**: Detect and redact sensitive information  \n",
    "- **Content Moderation**: Filter inappropriate language/content\n",
    "- **Factuality Checks**: Validate responses against source material\n",
    "- **Jailbreak Detection**: Prevent adversarial prompt attacks\n",
    "- **Competitor Monitoring**: Avoid mentioning competitors\n",
    "\n",
    "### Production Benefits of Guardrails\n",
    "\n",
    "**🏢 Enterprise Requirements:**\n",
    "- **Compliance**: Meet regulatory requirements for data protection\n",
    "- **Brand Safety**: Maintain consistent, appropriate communication tone\n",
    "- **Risk Mitigation**: Reduce liability from inappropriate AI responses\n",
    "- **Quality Assurance**: Ensure factual accuracy and relevance\n",
    "\n",
    "**⚡ Technical Advantages:**\n",
    "- **Layered Defense**: Multiple validation stages for robust protection\n",
    "- **Selective Enforcement**: Different guards for different use cases\n",
    "- **Performance Optimization**: Fast validation without sacrificing accuracy\n",
    "- **Integration Ready**: Works seamlessly with LangGraph agent workflows\n"

    "##### ✅ Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding guardrails increases complexity in the graph and needs to be tested to get it right.\n",
    "Found that PII detection and redaction is pretty buggy and unreliable. Would need to be handled more completely in production.\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Input Validation Node (input_guardrails_node):\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Jailbreak Detection: Blocks attempts to bypass safety measures\n",
    "  - Topic Restriction: Ensures queries stay within allowed topics (student loans, financial aid, etc.)\n",
    "  - PII Detection & Redaction: Automatically redacts sensitive information like SSNs, credit cards\n",
    "\n",
    "  2. Output Validation Node (output_guardrails_node):\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Content Moderation: Ensures responses are professional and appropriate\n",
    "  - PII Protection: Redacts any PII that might appear in responses\n",
    "  - Factuality Checks: Framework for validating against source material (extensible)\n",
    "\n",
    "  3. Enhanced Agent State:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - guardrails_passed flag to track validation status\n",
    "  - guardrails_error to store error messages\n",
    "  - is_input_stage to differentiate between input/output processing\n",
    "  - requires_new_input flag to indicate retry is needed\n",
    "  - retry_count to track attempts\n",
    "\n",
    "  4. Retry Prompt Node:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Provides user-friendly error messages\n",
    "  - Tracks retry attempts (default max: 3)\n",
    "  - Shows attempt count to user\n",
    "\n",
    "  5. Helper Function:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - invoke_agent_with_retry() demonstrates retry handling\n",
    "  - In production, this would integrate with your UI to get new input\n",
    "\n",
    "  Key Implementation Points:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. When guardrails fail, the graph routes to retry_prompt_node\n",
    "  2. Retry prompt provides helpful feedback about what went wrong\n",
    "  3. State tracks retry count to prevent infinite loops\n",
    "  4. Application layer can check requires_new_input flag to prompt user\n",
    "\n",
    "  The graph now gracefully handles failed inputs by:\n",
    "  - Informing the user what went wrong\n",
    "  - Suggesting valid input types\n",
    "  - Tracking retry attempts\n",
    "  - Preventing infinite retry loops\n",
    "\n",
    "  In a real application, when requires_new_input is true, the UI would:\n",
    "  1. Display the error message\n",
    "  2. Show a new input field\n",
    "  3. Re-invoke the agent with the new input\n",
    "  4. Continue until success or max retries\n",
    "\n",
    "Diagrams:\n",
    "  1. Main Architecture Flow: Added the retry prompt node and proper flow for handling failed input guardrails with retry logic and max attempt limits\n",
    "  2. Guardrails Detail Flow: \n",
    "    - Input: Jailbreak → PII Detection/Redaction → Topic Validation\n",
    "    - Output: Content Moderation → Factuality Check (when RAG context available)\n",
    "  3. Complete State Management: Added detailed state diagram showing:\n",
    "    - Internal states within Input/Output guardrails nodes\n",
    "    - Retry logic with attempt tracking"
