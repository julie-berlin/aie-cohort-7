              "\"People failed to pay back their loans primarily because of several interconnected reasons highlighted in the complaints:\\n\\n1. **Lack of Clear and Timely Information:** Borrowers were often not adequately informed about when their repayment obligations would resume, changes in loan servicers, or specific payment details, leading to confusion and unintentional delinquency.\\n\\n2. **Interest Accumulation and Limited Payment Options:** Many borrowers only received options like forbearance or deferment, which allowed interest to continue accumulating. Lowering payments or delaying repayment often resulted in the total debt growing, making it harder to pay off later.\\n\\n3. **Financial Hardship and Unaffordable Payments:** Borrowers faced financial hardships such as stagnant wages, rising living costs, or job instability, which made meeting repayment obligations difficult without sacrificing essential expenses.\\n\\n4. **Loan Management and Servicer Issues:** Complaints about mismanagement, transfer of loans without notification, and inability to apply payments toward principal hindered repayment efforts. Some borrowers reported ineffective or predatory repayment plans under servicers like Nelnet or EdFinancial.\\n\\n5. **Unanticipated Debt Growth and Confusing Statements:** Discrepancies in loan balances, undisclosed interest, and lack of detailed statements made it difficult for borrowers to understand their actual debt and plan for repayment.\\n\\n6. **Loan Servicing and Policy Limitations:** Some borrowers were denied income-driven repayment plans, and the availability of extensive forbearance periods led to prolonged debt periods, often with the debt growing faster than payments could reduce it.\\n\\nIn essence, a combination of lack of transparency, financial hardship, mismanagement by servicers, and the structural design of repayment options contributed significantly to borrowers' inability to repay their loans effectively.\""

        "Multi-query retrieval improves recall by addressing the fundamental limitation that a single query formulation may not capture all relevant documents, even when those documents contain the information the user seeks. This is called the **vocabulary mismatch problem**. Users and document authors often use different terminology to describe the same concepts. Multi-query generates several reformulations of the original query, typically 3-5 variations that:\n",

        "\n",
        "1. Each un-split \"document\" will be designated as a \"parent document\" (You could use larger chunks of document as well, but our data format allows us to consider the overall document as the parent chunk)\n",

        "4. When we query our Retriever, we will do a similarity search comparing our query vector to the \"child chunks\".\n",
        "5. Instead of returning the \"child chunks\", we'll return their associated \"parent chunks\".\n",

        "\n",
        "Interquartile Range (IQR) is likely the best choice for FAQ content for several reasons:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Robustness to outliers: FAQs often contain a few highly similar pairs and some completely distinct ones. IQR handles this distribution better than standard deviation, which gets skewed by extreme values.\n",
        "- Adaptive to content distribution: Unlike percentile methods that impose fixed cut-offs, IQR adapts to the actual similarity distribution in your FAQ dataset.\n",
        "- Interpretable boundaries: IQR provides clearer decision boundaries for what constitutes \"typical\" vs \"unusual\" similarity levels in repetitive content.\n",
        "\n",
        "The change of thresholding method is likely not sufficient for FAQs. In addition, we'd want to combat over-fragmentation, similarity inflation and weak boundary detection problems. A few ideas for algorithmic changes:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Content-Aware Preprocessing: Implement FAQ-specific parsing to identify question-answer pairs as atomic units. Treat each Q&A pair as the minimum chunk size, preventing fragmentation of logically connected content.\n",
        "- Similarity Normalization: Apply domain-specific adjustments to similarity thresholds. Since FAQ language is inherently repetitive, we need to recalibrate what constitutes \"semantically different\" content in this context.\n",
