    "\n",
    "**Embedding Caching:**\n",
    "The process of embedding is typically very time consuming and expensive:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Send text to OpenAI API endpoint\n",
    "2. Wait for processing  \n",
    "3. Receive response\n",
    "4. Pay for API call\n",
    "\n",
    "This occurs *every single time* a document gets converted into a vector representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Our Caching Solution:**\n",
    "1. Check local cache for previously computed embeddings\n",
    "2. If found: Return cached vector (instant, free)\n",
    "3. If not found: Call OpenAI API, store result in cache\n",
    "4. Return vector representation\n",
    "\n",
    "**LLM Response Caching:**\n",
    "Similarly, we cache LLM responses to avoid redundant API calls for identical prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits:**\n",
    "- ⚡ Faster response times (cache hits are instant)\n",

    "### 🛡️ What are Guardrails?\n",
    "\n",
    "Guardrails are specialized validation systems that help \"catch\" when LLM interactions go outside desired parameters. They operate both **pre-generation** (input validation) and **post-generation** (output validation) to ensure safe, compliant, and on-topic responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Categories:**\n",
    "- **Topic Restriction**: Ensure conversations stay on-topic\n",
    "- **PII Protection**: Detect and redact sensitive information  \n",
    "- **Content Moderation**: Filter inappropriate language/content\n",
    "- **Factuality Checks**: Validate responses against source material\n",
    "- **Jailbreak Detection**: Prevent adversarial prompt attacks\n",
    "- **Competitor Monitoring**: Avoid mentioning competitors\n",
    "\n",
    "### Production Benefits of Guardrails\n",
    "\n",
    "**🏢 Enterprise Requirements:**\n",
    "- **Compliance**: Meet regulatory requirements for data protection\n",
    "- **Brand Safety**: Maintain consistent, appropriate communication tone\n",
    "- **Risk Mitigation**: Reduce liability from inappropriate AI responses\n",
    "- **Quality Assurance**: Ensure factual accuracy and relevance\n",
    "\n",
    "**⚡ Technical Advantages:**\n",
    "- **Layered Defense**: Multiple validation stages for robust protection\n",
